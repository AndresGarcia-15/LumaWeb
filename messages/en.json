  "ChartsParameters": {
    "entropyTitle": "Entropy",
    "entropyDescription": "Entropy is typically calculated from the image histogram, which represents the frequency distribution of pixel intensity levels. When an image has a uniform distribution of intensity levels, meaning all intensity levels are equally probable, the entropy is high due to greater uncertainty or disorder. Conversely, a highly skewed or concentrated distribution results in low entropy. When an image is very diverse, it generally implies low entropy.",
    "meanIntensityTitle": "Mean Intensity",
    "meanIntensityDescription": "Mean intensity represents the average of all pixel intensity values in an image. Each pixel has an intensity value corresponding to its brightness or color. Mean intensity is calculated by summing all pixel intensity values and dividing by the total number of pixels. This measure is important in detecting objects or regions of interest, as it provides information about the illumination level of the scene.",
    "standardDeviationTitle": "Standard Deviation",
    "standardDeviationDescription": "Standard deviation measures the dispersion or variability of pixel intensity values relative to the mean. A high standard deviation indicates a wide spread of values, suggesting fine details or textures in the image. A low standard deviation suggests a more uniform or smooth image.",
    "fractalDimensionTitle": "Fractal Dimension",
    "fractalDimensionDescription": "Fractal dimension describes the irregularity or structural complexity of an object or image. Unlike integer dimensions, fractal dimensions can be non-integer, reflecting roughness or self-similarity at different scales. This measure is useful for characterizing texture, shape, and complexity in image processing, distinguishing textures, or detecting fractures and cracks.",
    "skewnessTitle": "Skewness",
    "skewnessDescription": "Skewness refers to the asymmetry in the distribution of pixel intensities. It is useful in identifying elongated or tilted patterns, quantifying symmetry in solar dynamics, and analyzing the shape and distribution of objects in an image.",
    "kurtosisTitle": "Kurtosis",
    "kurtosisDescription": "Kurtosis is a statistical measure describing the shape of the pixel intensity distribution in an image. It provides insights into the concentration and variability of intensity values, supporting texture analysis, image segmentation, and anomaly detection.",
    "uniformityTitle": "Uniformity",
    "uniformityDescription": "Uniformity measures the consistency or homogeneity of pixel intensity distribution. It indicates the balance of intensity across an image and is crucial for assessing image quality and visual feature consistency, aiding in object detection and segmentation.",
    "relativeSmoothnessTitle": "Relative Smoothness",
    "relativeSmoothnessDescription": "Relative smoothness measures the variation in pixel intensity in an image.",
    "tarumaContrastTitle": "Tamura Contrast",
    "tarumaContrastDescription": "Tamura contrast quantifies the intensity differences between adjacent pixels in an image.",
    "tarumaDirectionalityTitle": "Tamura Directionality",
    "tarumaDirectionalityDescription": "Tamura directionality captures the tendency of texture features to align in specific directions. It is valuable for analyzing textures, detecting patterns, and recognizing structures such as edges and fibers in an image.",
    "tarumaLinelikenessTitle": "Tamura Linelikeness",
    "tarumaLinelikenessDescription": "Tamura linelikeness measures the extent to which a texture exhibits line-like features. It is useful for detecting cracks in materials or segmenting elongated objects in images.",
    "tarumaCoarsenessTitle": "Tamura Coarseness",
    "tarumaCoarsenessDescription": "Tamura coarseness quantifies the granularity of texture details in an image. It is used in visual inspection to detect surface defects or segment textured regions.",
    "tarumaRegularityTitle": "Tamura Regularity",
    "tarumaRegularityDescription": "Tamura regularity measures the uniformity or repetition of texture patterns. It helps identify repetitive structures and is useful in pattern recognition and image segmentation.",
    "tarumaRoughnessTitle": "Tamura Roughness",
    "tarumaRoughnessDescription": "Tamura roughness quantifies texture granularity, aiding in defect detection and region segmentation."
